# WARNING

Do not build from main without full confidence in the state of the application. If there is no official release, please contact an admin for the correct branch. This wallet is still in early Beta. Use at your own risk.

Be vigilant for phishing attempts.

## Upcoming Changes to Git Flow

We will be shifting away from free-for-all, pre-release branch/commit pattern to a formalized Gitflow where the main branch is always ready. Please stay tuned!

### License

MobileCoin Desktop Wallet is available under open-source licenses. Look for the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for more information.

### Setup

Depending on your local platform, you'll need to add the correct version of [full-service binaries](https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/full-service/releases/tag/v1.0.0-pre.8) to the `./full-service-bin` directory. If you add the binaries, you will likely need to give permissions for the dev environment to run them. In the directory with the binaries, grant permission: `chmod +x full-service`.

### Dev

You'll need to start by installing the packages. At the root, run `yarn install` (or `yarn` if you're cool like that). Because this wallet has native packages, you'll need to drop into the app/ directory `cd app/` and run `yarn install` here as well. Once done, hop back up to the root directory (I know you know this, but `cd ..`).

Run the dev environment with `yarn dev`.

That's it!

(There's plenty of other commands, take a peak at the package.json scripts).

### Debugging

When you call `yarn dev`, the app will run with a Chrome inspect window for debugging convenience. If you want to debug the built or packaged app, please look closely at the `package.json` file for other commands.

If you need to debug the renderer (the interactive side of the app + the api request/responses from `full-service`), you can simply add the keyword `debugger` in the code. When inspecting in the Chrome window, javascript will stop at that line and allow you to quickly inspect the local state.

YOU CANNOT USE THE `DEBUGGER` KEYWORD IN A REACT'S RENDER RETURN VALUE. (The return value that looks an awful lot like html).

You may want to debug the main process. You can find a debugging tutorial [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/debugging-main-process).
