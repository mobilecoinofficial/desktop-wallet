        The MobileCoin Network uses an open source software protocol commonly known as the
        MobileCoin protocol. The MobileCoin protocol is designed to enable holders of digital tokens
        known as MobileCoins to send and receive peer-to-peer payments securely and privately
        through a digital wallet that can send and receive MobileCoins (MobileCoin Wallets).
        MobileCoins and MobileCoin Wallets enable a simple, secure, and private medium of exchange
        for consumers in countries of operation to manage and move their money using a currency of
        equivalent value across countries.
