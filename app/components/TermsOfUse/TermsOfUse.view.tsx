    <Box p={2} component={Typography} textAlign="justify">
      The MobileCoin Network operates utilizing an open source software protocol commonly known as
      the MobileCoin protocol. The MobileCoin protocol is designed to enable holders of digital
      tokens known as MobileCoins to send and receive peer-to-peer payments securely and privately
      through a digital wallet that is capable of sending and receiving MobileCoins (MobileCoin
      Wallets). MobileCoins enable a simple, secure, and private medium of exchange for consumers in
      countries of operation to manage and move their money using personal mobile devices and a
      currency of equivalent value across countries.
